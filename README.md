# HJA_microclimate

Code for analysis of the temporal consistency of microrefugia in the HJ Andrews forest.  All of the input data (described in the paper methods) should be placed in the data_input folder, and the scripts can then be executed by running "runner.R". The input data are from the publicy available sources listed in the methods. The dataset "GRIDMET_reduce.csv" can be obtained directly or built using the Google Earth Engine javascript file "build_gridMET.js".
